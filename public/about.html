            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content fade-in">
                <p>Deeper Life Campus Fellowship has been a beacon of hope and spiritual growth in the Ado Ekiti community for years. Located behind Trinity Hospital along Adebayo Road, our fellowship began as a small group of committed believers who sought to create a space where students and young adults could grow in their faith.</p>
                
                <p>What started as intimate gatherings has blossomed into a vibrant community that welcomes all who seek to know Christ more deeply. Our fellowship is built on the foundation of God's Word, characterized by authentic worship, meaningful relationships, and a commitment to serving both our local community and the broader world.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that every person who walks through our doors is precious to God, and we strive to create an environment where everyone can experience His love, find their purpose, and grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
